# EnterConnected

Looking for an easy way to organize activities with friends without having to worry about availability and interests? Looking to connect with friends, but unsure of the best way to reach out? EnterConnected is a free and easy way to create activities for all your friends to see, eliminating the hassle of scheduling.

## Inspiration

We built EnterConnected to provide an easy way to schedule activities. We hope that EnterConnected will encourage users to connect with friends and develop creative and entertaining activities for everyone to enjoy.

## What it does

Upon logging into [EnterConnected] (https://enterconnected.tech/#/) through a google account, users will be taken to the EnterConnected homepage where all of their current activities will be listed. To create new activities, the user can click on the "Add activity availability" button and fill out information for the new activity. Once an activity reaches the the minimum number of people required, the activity will appear in the "Scheduled activities" page, which is accessibile through the tab on the navbar.
